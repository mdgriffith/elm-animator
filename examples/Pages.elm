{-| Animated page transitions!

This example is meant to show a few things.

    1.  That page transitions are just like animating any other state, we'll just create an `Animator.Timeline Page` and animate with that.
    2.  How to use CSS keyframes by using the `Animator.Css` module
    3.  How to handle routing so that the url changes as your transition.
