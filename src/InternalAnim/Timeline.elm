{-| There's some nuance to when we can add events to a `Line`.

When interpolating we allow the interpolator to look ahead one event in order to calculate the desired velocity it should be at.

This lookahead only happens within Lines, which means we can only append to the current line if appending it would be after the event that we're using fro that calculation.

e.g.

        a------------b---------c-------d
            ^ now    ^---------^ these two events are used to calculate the desired velocity

So, if we have the above situation, then we could append to this line.

However, the below situation, we shouldnt.

        a-----------b---------c-------d
                                  ^ now

**However!** **Both queueing and interruptions should create a new \`Line**

    - This is to ensure that there is not retroactive effect.
    - Also!  If we're conditionally changing a `Line` via queueing, it means the animation will be different depending on the timing of when the queueing happens! Oof. What if the player in a game is mashing buttons and animations change intermittently? No Bueno.
