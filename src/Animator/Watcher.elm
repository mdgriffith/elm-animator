{-| An `Animator` knows how to read and write all the `Timelines` within your `Model`.

Here's an animator from the [Checkbox.elm example](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Checkbox.elm),

    import Animator.Watcher as Watcher

    animator : Watcher.Watching Model
    animator =
        Watcher.init
            |> Watcher.watching
                -- we tell the animator how
                -- to get the checked timeline using .checked
                .checked
                -- and we tell the animator how
                -- to update that timeline as well
                (\newChecked model ->
                    { model | checked = newChecked }
                )

Notice you could add any number of timelines to this animator:

    animator : Watcher.Watching Model
    animator =
        Watcher.init
            |> Watcher.watching
                .checked
                (\newChecked model ->
                    { model | checked = newChecked }
                )
            |> Watcher.watching
                .anotherChecked
                (\anotherCheckboxState ->
                    { model | anotherChecked = anotherCheckboxState }
                )

**Note** — You likely only need one animator for a given project.

**Note 2** — Once we have an `Animator Model`, we have two more steps in order to set things up:

  - [create a _subscription_](#toSubscription)
  - [_update_ our model](#update)
