# Getting started

@docs Timeline, init


# Transitioning to a new state

Now that we have a `Timeline` set up, we likely want to set a new **value**.

In order to do that we need to specify both —

  - the new state we want to be in
  - a `Duration` for how long this transition should take.

@docs to

@docs update, isRunning


# Interruptions and Queueing

In some more **advanced** cases you might want to define a _series_ of states to animate through instead of just going to one directly.

    Timeline.interrupt
        [ Timeline.wait (Timeline.millis 300)

        -- after waiting 300 milliseconds,
        -- start transitioning to a new state, Griffyndor
        -- Take 1 whole second to make the transition
        , Timeline.transitionTo (Timeline.seconds 1) Griffyndor

        -- Once we've arrived at Griffyndor,
        -- immediately start transitioning to Slytherin
        -- and take half a second to make the transition
        , Timeline.transitionTo (Timeline.seconds 0.5) Slytherin
        ]

@docs interrupt, queue

@docs Step, wait, transitionTo

@docs scale, delay


# Reading the timeline

You might be wondering, 'How do we get our value "out" of a `Timeline`?'

Well, we can ask the `Timeline` all sorts of questions.

{-| A timeline of `state` values.

Behind the scenes this is roughly a list of states and the times that they should occur!

-}
type alias Timeline state =
    Timeline.Timeline state


{-| -}
type alias Duration =
    Time.Duration


{-| Create a timeline with an initial `state`.

So, if you previously had a `Bool` in your model:

    type alias Model = { checked : Bool }

    -- created via
    { checked = False }

You could replace that with an `Animator.Timeline Bool`

    type alias Model = { checked : Animator.Timeline Bool }

    -- created via
    { checked = Animator.init False }

-}
init : state -> Timeline state
init first =
    Timeline.Timeline
        { initial = first
        , now = Time.absolute (Time.millisToPosix 0)
        , delay = Duration.milliseconds 0
        , scale = 1
        , events =
            Timeline.Timetable []
        , queued = Nothing
        , interruption = []
        , running = True
        }


{-| Delay the events of a timeline.

This is generally used in your view function to add a bit of variety when animating multiple elements.

        Animator.move (Animator.delay (Animator.millis 200) timeline) <|
            \state ->
                if state then
                    Animator.at 0

                else
                    Animator.at 1

This has a maximum value of 5 seconds.

If you need a longer delay, it's likely you want to create a separate timeline.

-}
delay : Duration -> Timeline state -> Timeline state
delay dur (Timeline.Timeline details) =
    Timeline.Timeline
        { details | delay = Time.maxDuration (Duration.milliseconds 5000) (Time.expand details.delay (Time.positiveDuration dur)) }


{-| Scale timeline durations.

    0.5 -> Animations take half as much time
    1.0 -> normal
    2.0 -> Animations take twice as long

**Note** - 0.1 is the lowest number allowed, and 5 is the highest.

This is generally used in your view function to add a bit of variety when animating multiple elements.

-}
scale : Float -> Timeline state -> Timeline state
scale factor (Timeline.Timeline details) =
    Timeline.Timeline
        { details | scale = min 5 (max 0.1 factor) }


{-| Get the current `state` of the timeline.

This value will switch to a new value when a transition begins.

If you had a timeline that went from A to B to C, here's what `current` would be at various points on the timeline.

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^    ^
current:       B    B    C    C
```

**Note** — If you want to detect the moment when you arrive at a new state, try using [`arrivedAt`](#arrivedAt)

-}
current : Timeline state -> state
current =
    Timeline.current


{-| Subtley different than [`current`](#current), this will provide the new state as soon as the transition has _finished_.

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^    ^
arrived:       A    B    B    C
```

-}
arrived : Timeline state -> state
arrived =
    Timeline.arrived


{-| Sometimes we want to know when we've arrived at a state so we can trigger some other work.

You can use `arrivedAt` in the `Tick` branch of your update to see if you will arrive at an event on this tick.

    Tick time ->
        if Animator.arrivedAt MyState time model.timeline then
            --...do something special

-}
arrivedAt : state -> Time.Posix -> Timeline state -> Bool
arrivedAt state =
    Timeline.arrivedAt ((==) state)


{-| Again, sometimes you'll want to supply your own equality function!
-}
arrivedAtWith : (state -> Bool) -> Time.Posix -> Timeline state -> Bool
arrivedAtWith =
    Timeline.arrivedAt


{-| Get the previous `state` on this timeline.

As you'll see in the [Loading example](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Loading.elm), it means we can use `previous` to refer to data that we've already "deleted" or set to `Nothing`.

How cool!

```ascii
          A---------B---------C
               ^    ^    ^
previous:      A    A    B
```

-}
previous : Timeline state -> state
previous =
    Timeline.previous


{-| Check to see if a `state` is upcoming on a timeline.

**Note** — This can be used to ensure a set of states can only be [`queued`](#queue) if they aren't already running.

**Note 2** — This only checks if an event is in the _future_, but does not check the value you're currently at. You might need to use [`arrived`](#arrived) as well if you also care about the current state.

-}
upcoming : state -> Timeline state -> Bool
upcoming state =
    Timeline.upcoming ((==) state)


{-| For complicated values it can be computationally expensive to use `==`.

`upcomingWith` allows you to specify your own equality function, so you can be smarter in checking how two value are equal.

-}
upcomingWith : (state -> Bool) -> Timeline state -> Bool
upcomingWith =
    Timeline.upcoming
